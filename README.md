TAMER agent in the Lava World (grid world) environment and Lunar Lander.

Deep TAMER agent in Lunar Lander is not integrated with HIPPO Gym yet. TAMER is receiving feedback from an expert RL agent (no human in the loop)


HIPPO Gym directory contains a working copy of a deep TAMER agent integrated into HIPPO Gym in the Lock/Key environment (https://github.com/maximecb/gym-minigrid)
Instructions are also included for how to run the TAMER agent on your local machine. 

Next steps:
Integrate the Tabular Lava World environment into HIPPOGym. Still need to create a render function.
Still deciding if deep Tamer is needed for the Lock/Key. Tabular TAMER might work, or TAMER with a tile coding function appromxiator.
