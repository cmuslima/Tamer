<h2>Invitation to Participate:</h2>
<p> We invite you to participate in this study about providing feedback or guidance to accelerate the learning of an AI agent.</p>

<h2>Purpose of the Study:</h2>
<p>The purpose of this study is to show that humans and agents can collaboratively make better and faster decisions to solve 
tasks in complex, uncertain domains. By better decisions, we mean how to act in a given situation so that long term 
advantage of taking such an action is maximized. By faster decisions, we mean that such an AI agent leveraging human
feedback would make faster decisions in an unseen situation.</p>

<h2>Participation:</h2>
<p>  If you wish to participate in this study, you will be asked to first complete a small task (playing/analyzing a video game) 
online, provide feedback and guide the AI agent by going to an online simulation tool by following the url (website link) 
provided, and complete a short survey. The study should take you approximately 20 minutes to complete. You do not have to 
answer any questions that you are not comfortable with, and you may stop at any point by simply closing the window and no 
data will be collected.</p>

<h2>Benefits:</h2>
<p>There are no direct benefits of taking part in this study except for (hopefully) enjoying these different tasks.</p>

<h2>Risks:</h2>
<p> This study involves minimal risk which includes minor fatigue due to the concentration required to finish the task. There is 
also the normal risk of interacting with a computer, e.g., long-term symptoms from muscle reuse like carpal tunnel syndromes. 
You can withdraw from the study at any point till submitting the response.
</p>

<h2>Confidentiality and Anonymity:</h2>
<p> All results from the study will remain confidential. We will only use results from the study for the purposes of this research. 
The only people who will have access to the research data are the Principal Investigators and researchers working on this study.
Results will be published in pooled (aggregate) format. Your data will be anonymous as you will not provide your name or any 
personal information.</p>

<h2>Data Storage:</h2>
<p> The results will come from the surveys and logs based on what kind of feedback you provide to the AI agent. This data will be 
stored in AWS S3 within their Canadian data centers. Only researchers on this project will get access to this data.</p>
