<h2>Applying the Uniform Strategy</h2>
<font size = "5">  
    <p>This is the Lava World game.
    In this game, a player starts at the state marked 
    with the letter, S, and the goal is to reach the goal state marked with the letter, G.
    However, there are lava spots throughout the maze! If the player falls into a lava state, then the player loses and a new episode will start!
    Suppose our AI agent took the path that's highlighted in green to reach the goal. We also show
    the action the agent took for each state.

    <br>Based on your understanding of the uniform strategy and the Lava World game, please answer the following question.</font>

    <font size = "5">  
<p>Consider the path the agent took in green. 
    We had four people provide feedback to the agent on this path.
    Feedback is marked with the black stars.
    Which person do you think provided feedback most closely to the uniform strategy?
