    <p> As a participant of this study, you will teach a computer agent how to solve a game. 
    In order to teach the agent how to win a game, you will provide the agent with negative or positive feedback.
    This feedback will help the agent understand when it's doing a good or bad job and will directly affect the agent's
    actions during the game.
