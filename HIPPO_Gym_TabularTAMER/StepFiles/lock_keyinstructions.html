<h2>Lock and Key Instructions</h2>
<font size = "5"> This is the Lava World game you have previously seen. However, we have changed the locations of the lava spots.
<br>The agent's goal remains the same: Reach the green goal state as quickly as possible without falling into lava!
<br>The agent is the blue circle. You will see the agent move throughout the grid, trying to reach the green goal state. 

<p>You will have 10 'tries' or 'episodes' to provide feedback to the agent. 
At the start of each episode, the agent will begin at the upper left most corner, as displayed below. 

<br>You can provide feedback to the agent by pressing the <strong> good</strong> or <strong> bad </strong> button. </p>

<p>To familiarize yourself with the game beforehand, we provided an image of it below.
<br> As you are interacting with the agent during the game, you will know what the current game episode is, what action the agent is taking, 
<br>what feedback you provided to the agent, and if the agent reached the goal.
