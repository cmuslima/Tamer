<h2>Description of the Game:</h2>
<p>
        This is the Lava World game.
        In this game, a player starts in the upper left corner of a maze (as displayed below)
        and the goal is to reach the end state marked with the letter, G.
        However, there are lava spots throughout the maze (marked in orange)! If the player falls into a lava state, then the player loses and a new episode will start!
</p>


<h2>Your task: Teach the agent how to solve Lava World</h2>
<p>
The agent is represented as a blue circle. At the start of each episode, the agent will begin at the upper left most corner.
The agent will move throughout the maze. Your job is to provide feedback to the agent by
pressing the <strong> good</strong> or <strong> bad </strong> buttons. 
This feedback will help the agent understand whether its behavior is good or bad. 
With your feedback, the agent can learn how to solve Lava World. 
You will have 20 episodes to provide feedback to the agent. Keep in mind, the agent will remember what it has learned in previous episodes. 
</p>




<p>To familiarize yourself with the game beforehand, we have provided an image below. As you are interacting with the agent during the game, you will know what the <strong>current game episode is,what action the agent is taking, and if the agent reached the goal</strong>. This information will be displayed <strong>above the maze</strong> as shown below.
