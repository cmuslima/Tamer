    <h1>What is this study about?</h1>
    
    
    <p> As a participant of this study, you will teach a computer agent how to solve a game. 
    In order to teach the agent how to win a game, you will provide the agent with negative or positive feedback.
    This feedback will help the agent understand when it's doing a good or bad job.</p>
    
    
    <p>To help you, the participant, provide feedback most effectively to the agent, we are suggesting you follow the strategy described below:</p>
    
    <p> We suggest you use the <u>uniform advising strategy</u>. 
    This strategy involves you continually providing feedback to the agent at a steady rate as it interacts in the game.
    <br>In the strategy, <strong> you do not want to restrict your feedback to specific locations of the game environment or at specific points in time.</strong>
