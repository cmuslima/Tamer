<h2>What is this study about?</h2>
<p>
This research study is being done to study the ways on how we can leverage human feedback to improve performance of autonomous systems.<br />
You are being asked to take part because you fall in our specified age range (over 18 years old) and have the basic knowledge in operating a<br />
computer that is necessary for the data collection.
Depending on the configuration of the study you are taking part in, it can take about 15-40 minutes<br />

<h2>Are there any benefits to me If I am in this study</h2>
<p>
There is no direct benefit to you from being in this study. <br />

However, through this study, we can understand more about the benefits of crowdsourcing or human-in-the-loop and <br />
how it can be use to solve problems of navigating robots in the future. <br />
There are potential benefits to educational, consumer, industrial, and military applications.<br />
